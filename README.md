## Comments on the Article: 
The recent crash involving a Tesla vehicle while in Full Self-Driving (FSD) mode raises concerns about the safety of advanced driver assistance systems. The incident, which is now being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), marks the first known crash involving a Tesla vehicle while in FSD mode and highlights the need for caution when using such systems. Despite Tesla's statements that drivers must always be in control of the vehicle and ready to take over if necessary, some owners have reported relying heavily on the system. This raises questions about the level of trust that should be placed in advanced driver assistance systems and highlights the importance of ensuring their safety before they are made widely available to the public. The incident also serves as a reminder of the responsibility that falls on both the car manufacturers and the drivers to ensure the safe operation of vehicles on the road.
